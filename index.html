                    <p>My dataset will be centred around Arctic Monkeys, an award-winning English (indie) rock band.
                        Arctic Monkeys was a clear choice for the theme of my dataset as I am their huge fan and I
                        believe that this project will allow me to explore their work on a deeper level. In addition, I
                        managed to find all types of data required for this project, namely, descriptive, notated and
                        acoustic data very easily.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The band was formed in 2002 in Sheffield by Alex Turner (signer, songwriter) and guitarist Jamie
                        Cook. Other members include Nick O'Malley (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Matt Helders (drums,
                        backing vocals). Up to now, Arctic Monkeys released 6 albums, with their debut album,
                        <i>Whatever
                            People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not</i> (2006), being the fastest-selling debut album by a
                        band in
                        UK chart history. What's also interesting is the fact that Arctic Monkeys is seen as one of the
                        first bands to gain public recognition via the Internet, gaining popularity through MySpace and
                        peer-to-peer file sharing services.</p>

                    <h2 class="title is-4">Task 2: Current manifestations of data relating to my dataset</h2>
                    <p>Interestingly, the band's official website does not feature any information about the band's
                        biography or discography. Therefore, for someone unfamiliar with Arctic Monkeys, it might be
                        quite difficult to quickly situate them in the music landscape. The official website, however,
                        provides links to all major music streaming platforms (e.g. Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer,
                        YouTube Music or TuneIn) where one can discover more information. I chose to explore how their
                        music is curated on Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer more closely.</p>
