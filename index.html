                    <p>My dataset will be centred around Arctic Monkeys, an award-winning British (indie) rock band from
                        Sheffield. Arctic Monkeys was a clear choice for the theme of my dataset as I am their huge fan
                        and I believe that this project will allow me to explore their work on a deeper level. Due to
                        their popularity, I managed to find all types of data required for this project (descriptive,
                        notated and acoustic data) very easily.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The band was formed in 2002 by Alex Turner (signer, songwriter) and guitarist Jamie Cook. Other
                        members include Nick O'Malley (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Matt Helders (drums, backing
                        vocals). Up to now, Arctic Monkeys have released 6 albums, with their debut album, <i>Whatever
                            People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not</i> (2006), being the fastest-selling debut album by a
                        band in
                        UK chart history even despite the fact that every song from this album has been available online
                        (for free) for months. Since Arctic Monkeys were one of the first bands to become popular due to
                        the Internet, they are often referred to as "the band of the web generation".</p>

                    <h2 class="title is-4">Task 2: Current manifestations of data relating to my dataset</h2>
                    <p>Interestingly, the band's official website does not feature any information about the band's
                        biography or discography. Therefore, for someone unfamiliar with Arctic Monkeys, it might be
                        quite difficult to situate them within the music landscape by only browsing the official
                        website. However, the website provides links to all major music streaming platforms (e.g.
                        Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, YouTube Music or TuneIn) where one can discover more information.
                        I chose to explore how their music is curated on Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer more closely.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Descriptive data</h3>
                    <p>Interestingly, the band's official website does not feature any information about the band's

                    <h3>Notated data</h3>
                    <p>Computerised scores for Arctic Monkeys can be found on different digital sheet music catalogues
                        such as musicnotes or MuseScore. I explored MuseScore in more depth, where one can search for a
                        song or an artist and then filter their search results by instruments, ensemble or copyrights.
                        MuseScore has sheets for all of their popular songs, including those that are my favourite.</p>

                    <h3>Acoustic data</h3>
                    <p>Acoustic data for Arctic Monkeys is available on all major music streaming platforms, YouTube,
                        SoundCloud and the band's website (live sessions). The acoustic data from YouTube can be
                        downloaded using various specialised programs and can be used for educational purposes without
                        the artist's permission (fair use).</p>
