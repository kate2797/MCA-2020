                    <p>For this week's first task, we have been presented with the following brief: “Imagine that you
                        have 1,000 different MEI files that you would include in your GitHub repository. Think through
                        the metadata elements that you think is most important for describing the music in your
                        1,000-song dataset.”</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In this scenario, I would include the following metadata in the MEI header:</p>
                    <br>
                    <!-- Table starts -->
                    <table class="table is-bordered is-striped">
                        <tbody>
                            <tr>
                                <td><strong>File description of the notated pieces</strong></td>
                                <td>title, composer, subtitle, arranger, encoder, date, file size, publisher
                                    name, publisher location, usage restrictions, source</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td><strong>Encoding description of the notated piece</strong></td>
                                <td>project description, sampling declaration </td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td><strong>Work description of the original pieces</strong></td>
                                <td>title, composer, lyricists, tempo, key, date, location</td>
                            </tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                    <br>
                    <p>Besides the most basic metadata (title and composer), I decided to add file size information
                        since it might be beneficial from an organisational perspective, for example, to determine the
                        size of the online storage needed. As I did not author the musical content of the MEI file, I
                        specified its original source. In addition, I believe that including a sampling declaration is
                        also very important. In the case of having 1000 files, it is possible that some files will be
                        incomplete, so we need to specify which parts of the source text they contain, or which methods
                        of sampling were used to create the collection. Lastly, I also added abstract aspects of the
                        piece such as key and tempo. This could allow me, for example, to filter the works by tempo or
                        key which might be very useful when working with a lot of files.</p>

                    <p>For the second task, the MEI file was modified according to my new schema. It can be previewed <a

                            target="_blank">here</a>. Some of the metadata was linked to the data found on existing
                        authorities (MusicBrainz). The following metadata fields: title, composer, lyricists and
                        geolocation were linked.</p>
