                    <p>For this week's first task, we have been presented with the following brief: “Imagine that you
                        have 1,000 different MEI files that you would include in your GitHub repository. Think through
                        the metadata elements that you think is most important for describing the music in your
                        1,000-song dataset.”</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In this scenario, I'd would include the following metadata in the MEI header:</p>
                    <br>
                    <!-- Table starts -->
                    <table class="table is-bordered is-striped">
                        <tbody>
                            <tr>
                                <td><strong>File description of the notated pieces</strong></td>
                                <td>title, composer, subtitle, composer, arranger, encoder, date, file size, publisher
                                    name, publisher location, usage restrictions, source</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td><strong>Encoding description of the notated piece</strong></td>
                                <td>project description, sampling declaration </td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td><strong>Work description of the original pieces (in a case that the author of the
                                        transcription differs from that of the original piece)</strong></td>
                                <td>title, composer, lyricists, tempo, key, date, location</td>
                            </tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                    <br>
                    <p>Besides the most basic metadata such as title and composer, I decided to add file size as well
                        since I believe that it might be beneficial from an organisational perspective e.g. to determine
                        the size of the storage I need. Since I did not author the MEI file, I also specified the source
                        from which my encoding is derived. In addition, I believe that the sampling declaration is also
                        very important. In the case of having 1000 files, it is possible that some files will be
                        incomplete, so we need to specify which parts of the source text they contain, or which methods
                        of sampling were used to create the collection. Lastly, I also added abstract aspects of the
                        piece such as key and tempo. This could allow me, for example, to filter the works by tempo or
                        key which might be very useful when working with a lot of files.</p>

                    <p>For the second task, we were asked to modify the MEI file according to our schema. My MEI file
                        can be previewed <a

                        I linked the some of the metadata to the data found on existing
                        authorities, in particular, I used MusicBrainz and linked the following metadata fields: title,
                        composer and all lyricists with their entries.</p>
