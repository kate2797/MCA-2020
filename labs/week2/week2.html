                    <p>For this week's task, I decided to transcribe one of my favourite songs by Arctic Monkeys called
                        Fluorescent Adolescent. My transcription is based on an arrangement by psychemmyy which, for
                        this particular song, had the most views and likes on MuseScore (see the arrangement <a
                            href="https://musescore.com/user/23706111/scores/4399971">here</a>). I
                        transcribed this piece by following the browser preview on MuseScore since I did not manage to
                        donwload the pdf version of it.
                        <br>
                        My MuseScore transcription is shown bellow. You can download the original MuseScore file <a
