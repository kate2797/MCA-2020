                    <p>Firstly, it is important to stress the fact that the Fluorescent Adolescent piece I analysed is
                        not a complete piece of music. Since I only transcribed the first 38 bars of the piece, the
                        results are not are as objective as they would be if I analysed a fully transcribed piece â€“ and
                        this hold true for both the results from Task 1 and 2.</p>

                    <p>To complete the first task, I worked with jSymbolic. The first 11 features presented are the
                        recommended ones. The rest of the features relating to
                        pitch, rhythm and tempo such as the first and last pitch were selected by me since I found them
                        worthy to include in my analysis. You can see my jSymbolic report below or you can download it
                        as a CSV file <a href="Fluorescent-Adolescent-feature-values.csv">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>To complete the second task, I worked with Python library called Music21 and generated two
                        visualisations. The graph on the left (Piano Roll) visualises how pitches evolve over time
                        whereas the graph on the right (Pitch Histogram) visualises the count of different pitch
                        classes.</p>
