                            <p>To complete the first task, I computed a similarity matrix. First, I needed to replace
                                country music with electronic music as that is the genre I am working with in this
                                project. For that two more electronic songs were added (<a
                                    href="https://freemusicarchive.org/music/EE7A">EE7A – Fairground</a>, <a
                                    href="https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Synapsis">Synapsis – Seven</a>). For both
                                the rock and classical genre, I replaced one of the examples provided
                                with the songs from the previous weeks. In the matrix, tracks 0-3 are classical, 4-6 are
                                rock and 7-9 are electronic. There is a clear separation between the classical and rock
                                genre which is indicated by the different-coloured squares. Interestingly, one of the
                                electronic tracks (track 8) is very similar to the classical tracks, with roughly 0.5
                                similarity score. Overall, if we look at the matrix we can see that the genre of rock
                                and electronic seem to more similar to each other than electronic and classical music.

                            <p>This plot nicely visualises what has been said in the previous paragraph. One of the
                                electronic songs appear in close proximity to the classical genre cluster. I listened to
                                it out of curiosity and it indeed was a rather slow and less loud electronic track.</p>
