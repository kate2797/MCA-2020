                            </p>
                            <p>The first task was to compute a similarity matrix. In order to do so, the country tracks
                                were replaced with electronic tracks since that is one of the genres I am working with
                                in this project. Thus, two more electronic songs needed to be downloaded from the Free
                                Music Archive (<a href="https://freemusicarchive.org/music/EE7A">EE7A – Fairground</a>,
                                <a href="https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Synapsis">Synapsis – Seven</a>). For both
                                the rock and classical genre, I replaced one of the example songs with the songs from
                                previous weeks.<br><br>In the matrix, tracks 0-3 are classical, 4-6 are rock and 7-9 are
                                electronic. Interestingly, one of the electronic tracks (track 8) is fairly similar to
                                the
                                classical tracks, with roughly 1.0 similarity score. Overall, if we look at the matrix,
                                we can see that the rock and electronic songs are more like each other than electronic
                                and classical songs.</p>

                                <p>The genre similarity plot visualises the separation between the individual genres.
                                    The songs of a similar genre appear clustered together. As previously discussed, one
                                    of the electronic songs appears to be similar to the classical ones, therefore it is
                                    visualised in a close proximity to the classical genre cluster.</p>

                    <h2 class="title is-4">Task 2: Transcription</h2>
                    <p>For this task I used the transcription created in MuseScore at the very beginning of the
                        course and exported it as a wav file. This file was loaded into Sonic Visualiser, exported as
                        MIDI and subsequently reopened in MuseScore which produced the transcription you can see below.
                        There is a clear difference between the original composition and the transcribed version from
                        both a sonic and a visual perspective. When I listened to both files in MuseScore, they sounded
                        very different. Visually, they also appear to be different. If we inspect both notations more
                        closely, we can see that the time signature differs, it is 4/4 in the original composition and
                        3/4 in the transcription. Additionally, the tempo marking is different, the transcribed version
                        is faster (120 bpm). Finally, the transcribed version is in E flat whereas the original
                        composition is in E major.</p>
